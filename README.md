# R_Classification_PCA_Project

This repository contains R Markdown documents demonstrating various statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, using R programming language. Each document is a comprehensive guide that includes explanations, code, and results for the implemented algorithms.

## Contents
**shringkage.Rmd:** An exploration of shrinkage methods in statistics, focusing on techniques to reduce estimator variance and handle multicollinearity in regression models. The document introduces the concept and application of shrinkage in statistical modeling, supported by R code examples.

**PCA.Rmd:** A detailed guide on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. This document uses the USArrests dataset to demonstrate the process of performing PCA, including data preprocessing, variance analysis, and dimensionality reduction. It also explores K-means clustering as a method for identifying groups within the data.

**classification.Rmd:** A comprehensive overview of various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The Smarket dataset from the ISLR library is used to illustrate the application of these methods in analyzing stock market data.

## Datasets
**USArrests:** Contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also includes the percent of the population living in urban areas.

**Smarket:** Includes percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index over 1,250 days, from the beginning of 2001 until the end of 2005. Data features include percentage returns for the five previous trading days, the volume of shares traded, today's percentage return, and whether the market went up or down.

## Results
Each document contains embedded R code that generates results inline with the text. These include statistical summaries, visualizations, and interpretations of the analyses. The results provide insights into the data and demonstrate the practical application of each algorithm.
